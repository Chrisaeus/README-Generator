## Description

This README Generator creates a high-end and professional-looking README file that is automaticalled formatted and populated using user input. Developers should focus on development, so This application streamlines this step of the process. It uses the Inquirer package to prompt for information that will be used to populate the appropriate sections of a newly created README file, which is placed in a generated-files directory located in the root directory. The README also contains a Table of Contents and badges for both a license, chosen by user input, and the Contributor Covenant CoC (which link to their respective documentation). 

This README file was created using this application!

4. Installation instructions

5. Usage instructions (You are here)

6. Contribution guidelines

7. Testing instructions

8. Choosing a license

9. GitHub username

10. E-mail address

Some prompts open an editor to recieve potentially larger bodies of text. Specific key controls may vary depending on the user's preferred editor.

The License section will be populated with a boilerplate notice or a complete license text depending on the license chosen from the provided dropdown menu. The corresponding badge will appear near the top of the README file.

By default, a badge linking to the Contributor Covenant CoC appears next to the license badge. If a user requires no further contribution guidelines, they should link to the CoC or otherwise direct towards the badge in the Contribution guidelines section.

Any part of the README.md can be changed or deleted after generation. It is recommended to add additional  links to  screenshots, GIFs, and/or videos of your application.

After the README is made, move it from the generated-files folder to the root folder of the corresponding application.
